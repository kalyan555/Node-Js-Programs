# V8 engine?
Chrome V8 is a JavaScript engine, which means that it executes JavaScript code. Originally, JavaScript was written to be executed by web browsers. Chrome V8, or just V8, can execute JavaScript code either within or outside of a browser, which makes server-side scripting possible.
Like a V8 (eight-cylinder) car engine, Chrome V8 is fast and powerful. V8 translates JavaScript code directly into machine code* so that computers can actually understand it, then it executes the translated, or compiled, code. V8 optimizes JavaScript execution as well.
*Machine code is a language that CPUs can understand. It is purely digital, meaning made up of digits.

## Compiling 
Compiling is a process that translates code from one programming language into another. Typically a compiler translates the code from a higher level of abstraction to a lower level of abstraction from human-usable languages like JavaScript into machine-readable code.
Chrome V8 performs what is called just-in-time compilation. Instead of compiling JavaScript in advance, it compiles the code at the same time that it is executed.
