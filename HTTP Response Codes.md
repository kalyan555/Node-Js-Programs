# What is http response code?

The Response Code is a 3-digit integer where the first digit of the Status-Code defines the class of response and the last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit:
## 1xx: Informational
It means the request has been received and the process is continuing.
## 2xx: Success
It means the action was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
## 3xx: Redirection
It means further action must be taken in order to complete the request.
#v 4xx: Client Error
It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
## 5xx: Server Error
It means the server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.
