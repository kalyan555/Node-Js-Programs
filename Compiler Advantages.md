# Advantages that compiled languages bring over interpreted languages

1.	Executing speed. 

2.	Secure process. It’s harder to change an executable than it is source.

3.	Bugs are less likely. A compiler has to check the whole source file and compile it, including all “seldomly executed” lines, but an interpreter just checks the line its about to execute, so many bugs can (and do) remain hidden for years … 

4.	Compiled code (often in different languages) can be linked into larger more sophisticated executables.

5.	Better copyright protection. As in 2, above, you can distribute executables without much fear someone will steal you hard work.
